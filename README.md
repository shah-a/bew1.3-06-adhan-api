# BEW1.3 Final Project: Adhan API

Written in: JavaScript (Node, Express, Mongo)

## Description

Bismillah al-Rahmaan al-Raheem.

Adhan API is a REST-ish HTTP API for checking adhan times at any location by latitude and longitude. Authentication is required for usage.

The word "adhan" refers to the Islamic call to prayer. When it's time to pray, a designated caller recites the adhan aloud to call everyone in the vicinity to come pray. The prayer is essentially a meeting with God. Muslims are obligated to pray five times daily, because regular communication keeps relationships strong.

The prayers are spaced out and performed at specific times throughout the day. Those times are: dawn (fajr), noon (dhuhr), evening (asr), sunset (maghrib), and night (isha). As sunrise and sunset times differ by day and place, so to do the daily prayer times.

These days, adhan apps are commonly used as a convenient way to check prayer times in advance rather than manually looking at the sun's position.
