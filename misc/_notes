TODO:
- Refactor DB queries to use lean()
  - Also think about requiring specific auth for /users/:(id/username)

Stretch:
- Figure out how to use express validator properly
  - Verify valid user inputs

-------------------------
That Allah has blessed me with the ability to make
an app that I'm THIS satisfied with is a ni'mah I
can never be sufficiently grateful for.

Writing this app has begun my journey with REST APIs.

It's not that the app is particular complex by nature
or anything. Rather, it's the organization of the
file structure that I'm most pleased with.

That, and of course the noble subject matter of the
app's theme :)
