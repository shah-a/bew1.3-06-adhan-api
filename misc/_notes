Next steps:

GET
/adhan             <-- today, all five, all locations
/adhan/:locationId <-- today, all five, :location
/adhan/fajr        <-- today, fajr, all locations
/adhan/dhuhr       <-- today, dhuhr, all locations
/adhan/asr         <-- today, asr, all locations
/adhan/maghrib     <-- today, maghrib, all locations
/adhan/isha        <-- today, isha, all locations

{
    "name": "home"
    "lat": 43.203995,
    "long": -79.920850
}

Stretch:
- Figure out how to use express validator properly
  - Verify valid user inputs. Right now, the entire
    program assumes/relies on the user feeding valid
    JSON inputs to req.body

That Allah has blessed me with the ability to make
an app that I'm THIS satisfied with is a ni'mah I
can never be sufficiently grateful for.

Writing this app has begun my journey with REST APIs.

It's not that the app is particularly complex/advance.
But it's the overall structure of the project that I'm
pleased with; I tried my best to organize the code and
the files in a clean, logical fashion.

That, and of course the noble subject matter of the
app's theme :)
