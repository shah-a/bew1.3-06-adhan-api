/*
 * Below, a ternary operator is being used for `const date`
 * to check for a year, month, and day in the context variable.
 * If all three were provided, it uses them to instantiate a `Date`
 * object. Otherwise, the current date is used.
 * The `month` section is being parsed as an integer so that `1` can
 * correctly be subtracted from it to undo the constructor's 0-index
 * for month fields.

Stretch:
- Figure out how to use express validator properly
  - Verify valid user inputs. Right now, the entire
    program assumes/relies on the user feeding valid
    JSON inputs to req.body

That Allah has blessed me with the ability to make
an app that I'm THIS satisfied with is a ni'mah I
can never be sufficiently grateful for.

Writing this app has begun my journey with REST APIs.

It's not that the app is particularly complex/advance.
But it's the overall structure of the project that I'm
pleased with; I tried my best to organize the code and
the files in a clean, logical fashion.

That, and of course the noble subject matter of the
app's theme :)
